# supporting-forests

This project contains the code to run the experiment of my thesis 'Binary & Non-Binary Random Forest & Support Vector
Machine for Commodity Price Prediction'.

To obtain the results from the paper, do the following.

- Run 'main.py' to obtain the predictions of all models. 
- 'Evaluation.py' contains functions to evaluate the prediction models.
- Test significance of the findings by using the functions in 'Significance.py'.
- 'Plots.py' allows you to create the same plots as in my thesis.

Thank you!
